## My Work-Day Scheduler App

This App is lite-version of a dayplanner for work-day (0900-1700) tasks.

## The Scope the App

In a world full of razzle and dazzle; there has to be a simple solution for the organization of errands and tasks. The purpose of this app is to give an individual a simple, yet proficient organizational tool for the day to day.

## The App in Action


## Technologies Utilized for this App

This App was built utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, JQuery, and Moment.JS.

## How to Use

1. Once the website is deployed, you are able to input data in the "Text Area" of each time row.

2. Once you have inputted the desired data, you just have to click save.

3. Based on the current time, you will see a color in the input area back-ground. 

#### Color Code

* Current Time = Yellow
* Future Time = Green
* Expired Time = Grey

## Future Developement

This app required the use of an API. For future development; I would like to add more fuctionality/intergration with the purpose of cross utilization to other applications: like Calendly or Google Calendar.
